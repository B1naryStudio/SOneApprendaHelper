# SOne Apprenda Helper

A helper website for our team to simplify working with the local Apprenda portal.
The main idea was to create a some kind of proxy with the direct links to the Apprenda portal pages.

Additionally, the website contains some usefull scripts and information for the development process.

You can use the project as an example of using the newest and fresh technologies and frameworks.
